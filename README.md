### **Leverage Iceberg for Superior Data Management**

By adopting Iceberg, CDP's Open Data Lakehouse solution empowers you with:

- **Enhanced Performance:** Experience faster query execution and improved data access.
- **Reduced Maintenance:** Benefit from simplified table management and automated tasks.
- **Greater Control:** Maintain ownership and governance of your data assets.

### **Scenario: Optimizing Aircraft Engine Design and Maintenance**

Imagine you work for an "Aircraft Engine Manufacturer" seeking a competitive edge in two crucial areas:

- **Engineering More Fault-Tolerant Engines:** Design engines with superior reliability and performance.
- **Proactive Predictive Maintenance:** Implement proactive maintenance strategies to identify and address potential issues before they escalate.

This runbook outlines a three-phase plan to achieve these goals:

- **Phase 1: Analyze Historical Data**
    - Identify engine types contributing the most to airline delays.
    - Gain insights to improve engine efficiency, reliability, and dependability.
- **Phase 2: Implement Ongoing Reporting**
    - Establish a continuous reporting system for engineers to track and analyze delay data.
    - Support ongoing efforts to refine engine design based on real-world performance.
- **Phase 3: Real-Time Analysis for Predictive Maintenance**
    - Transition to real-time analysis to proactively address issues in deployed engines and prototype designs.
    - Reduce downtime and enhance customer service through proactive maintenance.

### **Building a Data-Driven Culture: Roles and Responsibilities**

To achieve these objectives, we'll establish a collaborative data warehouse and data lakehouse environment:

- **Warehouse Administrators:**
    - Set up, monitor, and maintain the data warehouse infrastructure.
    - Ensure data security, governance, and compliance.
    - Support BI Analysts and end-user communities.
- **BI Analysts:**
    - Wrangle and curate data for quality and consistency.
    - Develop robust and performant data sets for analysis.
    - Build informative visual reports for decision-making.
- **End-User Community:** (1,000+ Aircraft Engineers)
    - Utilize data insights to improve engine design.
    - Develop preventative maintenance strategies for existing engines.

### **Key Questions for Data-Driven Engine Improvement**

To optimize engine quality, we'll focus on three critical questions:

1. **Engine Impact on Airline Delays:** Which engine types are most linked to airline delays? Analyze the root causes to improve engine efficiency, reliability, and weather resilience.
2. **Airline Utilization of Engines:** Identify which airlines use your engines to prioritize development efforts based on market share.
3. **Identifying Engines with Ongoing Issues:** Pinpoint engines consistently causing problems for proactive customer service and next-generation design modifications.

### **Getting Started with CDP and Iceberg**

This runbook demonstrates how CDP empowers the "Aircraft Engine Manufacturer" to gain a competitive advantage through performance, automation, and cost control. Explore the following modules to embark on your data-driven journey.
